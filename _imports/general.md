- Return properly marked — totalled scorecards to hospitality suite
  **IMMEDIATELY** following play. Whether you played well or not, be courteous
  to the other golfers by turning in your card as no prize awards can be made
  until **ALL** cards are accounted for.
- Scoring Results and Buyout Information is available at
  [duvallinvitational.com](https://duvallinvitational.com) and is
  updated regularly.
- Be courteous to the other golfers by seeking them out and promptly paying for
  your ½ of the auction buy out. Doing this before the auction is over is best.
  Please don't make the buyer hunt you down. If you can't connect prior to tee
  time, let Greg, Elwood or Myself know of your intent to buy half yourself. It
  MUST be prior to play.
- As in the past, Handicaps are what they are and are set by the computer.  The
  handicap committee only reviews handicaps for those the computer recommends a
  bump of more than 2 points in any year and for newcomers without a history.
  The committee reserves the right to adjust handicaps for any round for any
  newcomer.
