# Sunday Scramble Rules
## Florida Scramble
### AKA Step Aside Scramble

Sunday's format is a modified scramble called the Florida Scramble.
It's the same as a typical scramble with one twist. Only three players
hit shots after the tee shot. How it works:

- Players A, B, C, & D hit their tee shots. Just like a typical scramble, the
  team decides which drive to use. In this example they decide player A.
- On the 2nd shot, player A sits out. Only players B, C, & D hit the second
  shot. The team then selects player C's shot.
- On the third shot, player C sits out and player A is back in. Only players A,
  B, & D hit the third shot.
- This process continues until the ball is holed. No gimmies.
- On the next tee box, the process starts all over again and all 4 players hit
  their tee shots.

**TEE SHOT MODIFICATION** — Each Team must use 3 drives from each player. The
drives can be selected after everyone hits, but the team must use 3 drives from
EACH player during the round. A dot should be placed on the scorecard at the
hole under the persons name in which the drive was used.

**SCORING** — As you would expect, there is only one score for the team. You
will put it on the card the same way as previous days, but only on one line
under the A Player (Team Captain). You will record the score and the DuVall
Points as before. At the end of the round, the team will have one score and the
corresponding DuVall points listed.

**Absent Player Rule** — If your team is missing a player (3-man team), you will alternate taking shots
for that player by hole.  Ex. Player D is absent.  First Hole, player A plays
his own ball first for each shot and the shots for missing player D next.  Then
on the Second hole, player B plays his ball first for each shot and the shots
for missing player D second.  Third hole, player C plays both, etc.

When determining who will sit out the next shot (who’s ball will be used), in
the above example, when Player A is hitting the second shot (which is for
missing player D), it is to be clearly announced.  If that second shot (which is
missing player D’s ball) is the ball to be used, then player D does not get a
shot next, so Player A will only hit one shot (his own) on the next shot.
Conversely, if Player A’s first shot (his own) is the ball that is used for the
next shot, then Player A again, only hits one shot on the next ball but it’s
Player D’s shot.

There will also be a handicap adjustment for the team.  The missing players
handicap will be replaced with an average of the remaining three players.  This
will prevent the team from having an unfair advantage over the field if the
player missing is the D player.  Conversely, the team would still have a chance
to compete fairly if the missing player was the A player.
