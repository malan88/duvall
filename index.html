                As in the past, Handicaps are what they are and are set by the
                computer.  The handicap committee only reviews handicaps for
                those the computer recommends a bump of more than 2 points in
                any year and for newcomers without a history.  The committee
                reserves the right to adjust handicaps for any round for any
                newcomer.
