            <h1>Sunday Scramble Rules</h1>
            <h2>Florida Scramble</h2>
            <h3>AKA Step Aside Scramble</h3>
            <p>
                Sunday's format is a modified scramble called the Florida Scramble.
                It's the same as a typical scramble with one twist.  Only three players
                hit shots after the tee shot.  How it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players A, B, C &amp; D hit their tee shots.  Just like a typical
                    scramble, the team decides which drive to use.  In this example
                    they decide player A.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the 2nd shot, player A sits out.  Only players B, C &amp; D hit
                    the second shot.  The team then selects player C's shot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the third shot, player C sits out and player A is back in.
                    Only players A, B &amp; D hit the third shot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This process continues until the ball is holed.  No gimmies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the next tee box, the process starts all over again and all 4
                    players hit their tee shots.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>TEE SHOT MODIFICATION</strong> &mdash; Each Team must use 3 drives
                from each player.  The drives can be selected after everyone hits,
                but the team must use 3 drives from EACH player during the round.  A
                dot should be placed on the scorecard at the hole under the persons
                name in which the drive was used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>SCORING</strong> &mdash; As you would expect, there is only one
                score for the team.  You will put it on the card the same way as
                previous days, but only on one line under the A Player (Team
                Captain).  You will record the score and the DuVall Points as
                before.  At the end of the round, the team will have one score and
                the corresponding DuVall points listed.
